        <h1>About bmDub network</h1>
        <p>
          bmDub network is built by BMW people for BMW people. The goal is to
          show clean daily builds, not just trailer queens. Real street cars,
          real mods, real money spent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m building this to highlight B58 cars like my 540i, and to make it
          easier to find parts, shops, and ideas without getting flamed in
          comments.
